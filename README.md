This project implements a full data engineering pipeline using Python and pandas. It processes a realistic e-commerce dataset by taking in, cleaning, transforming, and processing transaction data. Object-oriented programming is used to structure the logic, and the final output includes serialization to CSV, JSON, and Parquet. The goal is to demonstrate real-world data handling in a reproducible and modular way.
